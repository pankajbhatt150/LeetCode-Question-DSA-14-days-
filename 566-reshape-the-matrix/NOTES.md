// now we will check if the 1 matrix size is equal or not to the size of second matrix
//  if the size is not equal we will simply return the same matrix
if(mat.size()*mat[0].size()!= r*c)

// here the mat.size() tell us about row of first matrix and mat[0].size tell us about column of second matrix and r*c restively tell us about row and column of second matrix
