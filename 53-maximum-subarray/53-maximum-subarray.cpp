          We want to answer the question:
          "What is the Max Contiguous Subarray Sum we can achieve ending at index i?"
  
          We have 2 choices:
  
          maxEndingHere + nums[i] (extend the previous subarray best whatever it was)
            1.) Let the item we are sitting at contribute to this best max we achieved
            ending at index i - 1.
  
          nums[i] (start and end at this index)
            2.) Just take the item we are sitting at's value.
  
          The max of these 2 choices will be the best answer to the Max Contiguous
          Subarray Sum we can achieve for subarrays ending at index i.
  
          Example:
  
          index     0  1   2  3   4  5  6   7  8
          Input: [ -2, 1, -3, 4, -1, 2, 1, -5, 4 ]
                   -2, 1, -2, 4,  3, 5, 6,  1, 5    'maxEndingHere' at each point
          
          The best subarrays we would take if we took them:
            ending at index 0: [ -2 ]           (snippet from index 0 to index 0)
            ending at index 1: [ 1 ]            (snippet from index 1 to index 1) [we just took the item at index 1]
            ending at index 2: [ 1, -3 ]        (snippet from index 1 to index 2)
            ending at index 3: [ 4 ]            (snippet from index 3 to index 3) [we just took the item at index 3]
            ending at index 4: [ 4, -1 ]        (snippet from index 3 to index 4)
            ending at index 5: [ 4, -1, 2 ]     (snippet from index 3 to index 5)
            ending at index 6: [ 4, -1, 2, 1 ]  (snippet from index 3 to index 6)
            ending at index 7: [ 4, -1, 2, 1, -5 ]    (snippet from index 3 to index 7)
            ending at index 8: [ 4, -1, 2, 1, -5, 4 ] (snippet from index 3 to index 8)
  
          Notice how we are changing the end bound by 1 everytime.
